## Hamiltonians of biological complexes

Here we present the Frenckel exciton Hamiltonians of the four biological complexes investigated in the study: the Fenna-Mathews-Olson (FMO) complex, the reaction center (RC) core from the photosystem II of higher plants, the RC extended by the CP43 complex as well as the RC extended by the CP47 complex. 

All files contain excited state energies and inter-site couplings in units of cm<sup>-1</sup>.
