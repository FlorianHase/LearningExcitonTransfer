# Exciton energy transfer databases

We provide the results of our exciton dynamics calculations with the HEOM method and the secular Redfield approach on the four datasets presented in the study. Excited state energies and inter-site couplings were sampled uniformly from the ranges in reported in the table below.


| Reference | Sites | Excited state energies [cm<sup>-1</sup>] | Inter-site couplings [cm<sup>-1</sup>] | 
| --------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |  
| FMO       |    8  |      12000 ... 12800                     |   -100 ... 100                         | 
| RC        |    8  |      14800 ... 15000                     |    -50 ... 50                          | 
| CP43      |   21  |      14800 ... 15100                     |    -60 ... 60                          |
